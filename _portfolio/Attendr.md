## Introduction

For our final project we developed an events driven dating application in Swift. You can read my development diary for the project [here](https://tomstuart92.github.io/FinalProject/).

In two weeks we built a commercially viable MVP, in a totally new language and paradigm (Swift) as well as building the backend infrastructure needed to support it. The backend of the application was built across a NodeJs server hosted on Heroku and Firebase for the realtime chat. The frontend of the application was built in Swift.

In this weekly project we were tasked with creating a Yelp clone in Ruby on Rails. Our project J-EATS, has all the core functionality of a restaurant review website.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery to go along with this case study." %}

For one weeks work in another new framework, I was pleased with the progress we made. The convention over configuration nature of Rails, made the project interesting, but for an application of this size, the bulk of Rails simply got in the way of an agile quick development cycle.

## Introduction

This is the base repository for my [Personal Blog](http://TomStuart92.Github.io)

It's built on top of a fork of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server.

- 2016-09-11: Integrate Facebook Comments and Google Analytics    
- 2016-09-04: Add Portfolio Page    
- 2016-09-01: Add Blog Index Page
- 2016-08-29: Update Home Page from Blog Post to custom Splash

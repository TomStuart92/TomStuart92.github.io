# Introduction

This week at Makers we learnt our second Language, Javascript. This was a lot of fun, and after getting over the initial learning curve, I can honestly say I'm a big fan. Suddenly the idea of being a full-stack Javascript developer has become an appealing possibility; but thats for another time.

In the meantime, I want to talk about a powerful tool that any developer should have in there toolbox when dealing with object oriented programming languages... Duck Typing.

This weekend we were set the task of writing a Javascript program that can keep track of the score of a bowling game. I purposely set out to really use Duck Typing as an integral part of my solution so in the remainder of the blog, I'll walk through some example code from my solution which should show the advantages of duck typing and also provide a nice introduction to Javascript!

# But Wait, What it Duck Typing?

**If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then its probably a duck.**

The idea of duck typing, is that in dynamical languages like ruby and javascript, the language doesn't care what the object it calls a method on is, as long as it understands that method call. Furthermore, we can substitute one object for another at runtime, allowing us to dynamically choose which object needs to be involved when the program is run.

For a simple example lets look at some ruby code:

```ruby

class Duck
  def fly
    puts 'The Duck is Flying'
  end
end

class Bird
  def fly
    puts 'The Bird is Flying'
  end
end

array = [Duck.new, Bird.new]
array.sample.fly => 'The Duck is Flying'

```

Here we randomly choose an object by sampling our array. But it doesn't matter which object is returned so we can call `.fly` on both. We say that these two classes are duck typed. They share the same public interface and so can easily be exchanged for each other.

## So back to the main event.

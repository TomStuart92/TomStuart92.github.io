## So it's the Saturday morning after a big night...
The night before holds blurred memories of the average curry and one too many beers. You roll over and look at your clock. 8am. You roll over and try to sleep it off.

Well no, not if you're a Makers Student; Instead I and four of my fellow students spent our Saturday at the 2016 Ruby (Un)Conference. One of the things we're continually being told is that it's important in the programming world to be active in the community. It will make a huge difference when we come to finding jobs due to the connections we'll make; but also that its an excellent way to keep up to date in the ever moving world of programming.

So yes, no lie in for us. The day was spent exploring some of the more bizarre aspects of the ruby environment. It was a really worthwhile experience in the end, and I learned a tonne about things I never even new existed. So lets dive in and talk a little about what each of the sessions covered.

## What's an (Un)Conference?

## Session One - Solving Problems using the Z3 library

## Session Two - Machine Learning

## Session Three - Opal

Ok, on to my favourite of the three sessions. Again Tomas led us through another slightly obscure ruby package, Opal. This one was slightly amazing. Opal is a set of gems that compiles your ruby code into javascript. What this means for practical purposes is that it makes it possible to write a full stack application, both front and back end, in pure ruby. Let that sink in for a minute.

Now the is a very immature project. Don't start throwing away your javascript just yet. That being said though we saw examples of pure JS, jQuery and React front-end code written purely in ruby.

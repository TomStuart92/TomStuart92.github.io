## So it's the Saturday morning after a big night...
The night before holds blurred memories of the average curry and one too many beers. You roll over and look at your clock. 8am. You roll over and try to sleep it off.

Well no, not if your a Makers Student; Instead I spent my Saturday at the 2016 Ruby Unconference. One of the things we're continually being told is that it's important in the programming world to be active in the community. It will make a huge difference when we come to finding jobs due to the connections we'll make.

So yes, the day was spent exploring some of the more bizarre aspects of the ruby environment. It was a really worthwhile experience in the end, and I learned a tonne about things I never even new existed. So lets dive in and talk a little about what each of the sessions covered.

## Session One - Solving Problems using the Z3 library

## Session Two - Machine Learning

## Session Three - Opal

## On an aside - Ruby v3

## Thoughts

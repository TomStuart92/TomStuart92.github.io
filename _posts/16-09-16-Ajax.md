Let's visit everyone's favourite [site](www.google.com). We send a GET request and receive in our browser a new web page:
![Google Home]({{ site.url }}/images/google_home.png)
This is a pattern you're hopefully familiar with. The same GET request/response pattern underpins much of the internet. Anytime you visit a new page, follow a link, or go stalk your ex's photos on Facebook, your browser follows this pattern.

But what if as a developer we want to update data on our page without refreshing it. This sort of dynamically served content is quite prevalent through out the internet. Google presents a great example:

![Google First Letter]({{ site.url }}/images/google_first.png)
![Google Home]({{ site.url }}/images/google_console.png)
![Google Home]({{ site.url }}/images/google_get_response.png)

# Introduction

One of the activities we take for granted as internet users is the ability to sign up to services. This process is common to just about every website and we rarely notice it as long as it works. But there are  some interesting principles that underline user sign up and sign in.

So lets have a look at one implementation of a user system. This version is realistically quite simple, but it shows just how much complexity we overlook in just being able to log in to a website.

# Stage One - Sign Up

Imagine you've found the most amazing website in the world. You can't wait to get started doing whatever it is this website offers. You click on the sign up link. What happens next?

Well if its like 99.99% of websites on the internet you'll probably be faced with something that looks a little like this:

![SignUp Form]({{ site.url }}/images/pp_sign_up.png)

This is a simple html form. Stripping away the visual aspects it looks something like this:

```html
<form action='/users/signup' method='post'>
    <label for="email">Email address</label>
      <input type='email' name='email' placeholder = 'Email'  required>
    <label for="Name">Full Name</label>
      <input type='text' name='name' placeholder = 'Name'  required>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
      <input type='text' name='username' placeholder = 'Username'  required>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
      <input type='password' name='password' placeholder = 'Password'  required>
    <label for="password_confirmation">Password Confirmation</label>
      <input type='password' name='password_confirmation' placeholder = 'Password Confirmation'>
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
```
Simple right? We've got a label and input for each of our needed fields. When the user presses the Sign Up button a POST request is sent to the `/users/signup` URL.

But even here we have concerns. We've made each field required as an initial check on input, but this is not sufficient to protect our database as we'll see later. We'll have to add constraints to our database as well.

What about the password fields? How are they secured? Well one of the most useful tools I've found so far, is the google chrome developer tools. Once switched on in your preferences they allow you to interact with a web page:

![Google Dev Tools]({{ site.url }}/images/pp_google_dev.png)

The first tab shows us the html behind the site and lets us explore through the way the visual aspects are constructed.

If we move to the network tab, we can watch all the requests our browser makes to the server. If we turn this on while we sign up we can see the POST request that is sent when the user clicks sign up:

![Sign Up POST]({{ site.url }}/images/pp_security.png)

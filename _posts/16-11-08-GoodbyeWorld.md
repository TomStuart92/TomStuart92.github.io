The end has come. It's sad and scary. But that's ok.

Twelve weeks of hard work, long days, coding nightmares and final projects have come to an end. I wanted to mark the occasion by writing down some of my thoughts of the last three months.

It's been an incredible journey. To go from zero coding ability to building a full-stack swift app in two weeks was always going to be a challenge, but one that I'm proud of how I rose to. The quality of the code I've been writing has changed exponentially, something you can witness if you read this blog is chronological order. It's a really rewarding experience to be able to see such a dramatic improvement in quality so quickly.

When I started the course, I was fairly sure that this was what I wanted to do. But now, after honing my skills, I know that this line of work is for me. The logic puzzles, the joy from creating something, the need to always be learning; these are all things I felt missing from previous jobs.

All the praise in the world must go to Makers Academy. Honest to god, if anyone reading this has any interest in learning to code, I cannot praise Makers highly enough. The environment and support they provide mean you'll have to work pretty hard not to succeed.

But ultimately, the greatest thing about the course was the 23 other students who took the journey with me. I could not have hoped for a more amazing, intelligent and fun group of people to spend three months banging our heads against desks/monitors/macbooks/walls/pingpongtables with. It has been a singular joy getting to know them all, and it is them whom I will miss the most.

It's always sad when something like this ends. It so consumes your life that there will always be such feelings. But I'm excited to move on the next step in my programming career. Finding the right next step will be just as much of a challenge as the previous three months, and is one I'm excited to face into.

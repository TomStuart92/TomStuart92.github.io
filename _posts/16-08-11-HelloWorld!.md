Why hello there. Thank you for stopping by at my little patch of the internet. This blog was set up to look at technical programming topics from a beginners perspective.  

What qualifications do I have to write such a blog?

Well realistically, none at all.

I'm a twenty-four year old Australian/Brit who has taken the plunge and enrolled in Makers Academy to learn how to code. Up to this point, I studied Theoretical Physics at University, worked at a consultancy in Data Analytics, climbed a few mountains, travelled from Sydney to London without flying, ran a wine cellar for two years and completed the Kokoda Trek in six days.
But I feel this is my biggest challenge yet.

Over the next 12 weeks I will be learning a whole host of new languages, methodologies and best practices. I'm sure there will be many late nights, countless coffee stops and endless hair pulling. But at the end I hope to be able to secure a job as a junior developer.

So to answer the question, my only qualification is that I'm a beginner too I hope that will lead to a gentler introduction to these topics, than reading an experts take. I also enjoy making terrible puns, so if you're a fan of that, then feel free to stick around. Otherwise I hope you do find something of use here.

Tom Stuart

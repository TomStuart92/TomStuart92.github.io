'Who are you?', I hear you ask dear reader.
Another individual finding there way through the infinite mess of life?
A complex and multifaceted person with a series of unique talents and skills?
Someone with interesting and insightful things to say?

Well most people call me Tom.

I'm a twenty-four year old Australian/Brit who has taken the plunge and enrolled in Makers Academy to learn how to code. Up to this point, I studied Theoretical Physics at University, worked at a consultancy in Data Analytics, climbed a few mountains, travelled from Sydney to London without flying, ran a wine cellar for two years and completed the Kokoda Trek in six days.
But I feel this is my biggest challenge yet.

Over the next 12 weeks I will be learning a whole host of new languages, methodologies and best practices. I'm sure there will be many late nights, countless coffee stops and endless hair pulling. But at the end I hope to be able to secure a job as a junior developer.

I've set up this blog to explore different ideas, and technical concepts I discover on this journey.
I hope to do so in a way as to be accessible to those with very limited technical knowledge.
It shouldn't be too hard. That's where I am at the moment!

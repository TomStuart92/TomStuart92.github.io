# Introduction

**We're not taught how to write code at Makers Academy.** Sure we learn a whole load of syntax, paradigms, best practices and design patterns. But that's not really what we're here to learn. What we actually learn is how to learn. In the context of Makers, the real end goal is to be able to approach a language/topic/concept we've never seen before and quickly get comfortable applying it.

I've always been the jump in at the deep end kind of guy, so this weekend I decided to test my skills and look at React. To skip to the punchline:

- I Love React. It's an incredibly powerful tool that feels intuitively right to work in.
- Makers Academy has done what it set out to achieve. I was able to pick up a new framework and have built a fairly descent single page application within a single weekend.

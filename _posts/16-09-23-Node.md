# Introduction

So apart from a 2am A&E trip and a severely sprained ankle, this week at Makers Academy has been a lot of fun. Set the challenge of building an AirBNB clone in small groups, we decided the difficulty of working in groups on a new project for the first time wasn't enough. Therefore, with much aplomb, we set out to complete the project using full-stack Javascript. The complete stack we ended up using was:

Backend:
- Bookshelf/Knex  
- knexCleaner
- NodeJS  
- PostgreSQL  

Frontend:
- JQuery
- Embedded Javascript  
- Bootstrap CSS  

Testing:
- Jasmine-Node
- Zombie  

As we only learnt Javascript last week, this presented the sort of challenge we were looking for, having used none of the backend or testing frameworks before. For the rest of the post we'll look at some example code to give a flavour of our final solution.

## Jasmine-Node and Zombie

Being excellent TDD-ers lets look at the testing frameworks first. We used a combination of Jasmine-Node and Zombie for our testing. Zombie is a headless browser, which allows us to write tests that explore our website in a browser, without having to have an open browser window.

Once properly integrated with jasmine this means we can write tests that visit pages, fill in forms, and click buttons. Lets look at an example of a feature test for logging into our account:

```Javascript
describe('Login testing', function(){

  beforeEach(function(){
    server.listen(3000);
    browser.deleteCookies();
    knex('users').insert({
      email: 'rosie@allott.com', password: '$2a$10$MjmF1z/VeNe7V5asctIbDOyM8fJeqGeMYFUni7V5Xt80QL5hGCn8G'
    });
  });

  afterEach(function(){
    server.close();
    knexCleaner.clean(knex);
  });

  describe("users/login", function(){
    it("should be able to log in", function(next){
      browser.visit(url + '/users/login', function(err){
        browser.fill('#email-address', 'rosie@allott.com');
        browser.fill('#password', 'password');
        browser.pressButton('#login', function(){
          expect(browser.html("body")).toContain("Successfully logged in");
          next();
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

We start with a beforeEach block which runs before each test. In this block we start a new server, delete all cookies saved in the browser, and insert a test user into our database. The password are saved salted hash for security, and so we insert a known hash (this one equals 'password').

Our afterEach block performs the reverse operation, we close our local server, and delete all entries from our database using knexCleaner.

Finally we get to our first test. This test:
1. Visits the '/users/login' path   
2. Fills in the form on that page with the details that match those in our database   
3. Clicks the login buttons   
4. Asserts that the new page, has the text - 'Successfully logged in'   

While this assertion may not be the most full proof way to check the login has been successful lets run with it for now.

# Introduction

This week we've been tasked with building a single page application entirely in Javascript. This means no other frameworks so no Jasmine, Node, Express, or jQuery to help out. The first challenge we had to solve is that without a testing framework, it becomes pretty difficult to test drive your applications development.

So to fix this, our first task was to build our own custom test framework to allow us to TDD the application.

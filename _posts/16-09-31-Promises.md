# Introduction

We've talked a couple of times about Javascript's asynchronicity, and today I want to write a little about one of the ways we can cope without resulting to callbacks. Really, I promise this will be really interesting.

A Promise object is used for asynchronous computations and represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never. It allows you to define functions to be called on an asynchronous action's eventual completion.
